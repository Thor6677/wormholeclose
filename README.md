# Wormhole Closing Tool

This repository contains a minimal web interface for experimenting with a hypothetical wormhole closing device. The project currently consists of a single HTML page and is intended as a simple example.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Usage

When you open the page you will see controls to initiate the wormhole closing procedure. Interact with the page elements (e.g. a "Close Wormhole" button) to simulate shutting down a wormhole connection. As this is only a demonstration, the page performs no real actions beyond displaying the interface.
