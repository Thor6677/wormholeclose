# Wormhole Closing Tool

This repository contains a minimal web interface for experimenting with a hypothetical wormhole closing device. The project currently consists of a single HTML page and is intended as a simple example.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Usage

Open the page and start typing a wormhole code. You can pick a suggestion with the mouse or hit **Enter** once the desired code appears. After a wormhole is selected its current mass state (Stable, Unstable or Critical) and a goal (close or crit) become available. Clicking **Start** sets the initial remaining mass and shows the Mass Tracker.

Use the Mass Tracker to subtract your ship jumps and see how much mass remains to reach the goal. The **Calculate Plan** button estimates how many ships to send out and back in a single cycle using the current ship mass.
