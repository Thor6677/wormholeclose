# Wormhole Closing Tool

This repository contains a minimal web interface for experimenting with a hypothetical wormhole closing device. The project currently consists of a single HTML page and is intended as a simple example.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Usage

Open the page and start typing a wormhole code to select one from the built in list. After you choose the hole you can specify its current mass state (Stable, Unstable or Critical) and whether you want to close the hole completely or merely mass‑critical it. Clicking **Start** sets the initial remaining mass and shows the Mass Tracker.

Use the Mass Tracker to subtract your ship jumps and see how much mass remains to reach the goal. The **Plan Jumps** button will provide a step‑by‑step sequence using the selected ship mass.
