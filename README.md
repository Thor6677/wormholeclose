# Wormhole Closing Tool

This repository contains a minimal web interface for experimenting with a hypothetical wormhole closing device. The project currently consists of a single HTML page and is intended as a simple example.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Usage

When you open the page you can search for a wormhole type and view its basic information. After selecting a wormhole, the Mass Tracker panel lets you keep track of the remaining mass. Choose a ship hull from the built-in list or enter custom cold/hot mass values, then record each jump to see how the wormhole state changes from **Stable** to **Unstable** and finally **Critical** as mass is depleted.
